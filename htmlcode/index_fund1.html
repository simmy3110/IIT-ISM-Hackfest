      <h2 class="fs-title">Project:<br> IOT Based Automatic Vehicle Accident Detection and Rescue System</h2>
      <h3 class="fs-subtitle"> This proposed IOT based accident detection system 
        helps to reduce the loss of life due to accidents and also reduces the time
         taken by the ambulance to reach the hospital. To detect the accident there 
         is accelerometer sensor present in this rescue system and the GSM module
          included sends messages about the location to the respective guardian and
           rescue team. With the help of accelerometer sensor signal, a severe accident 
           due to an obstacle can be recognized.</h3>
